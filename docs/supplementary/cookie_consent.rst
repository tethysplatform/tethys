Cookie Consent
**************

Tethys Platform supports optional cookie consent management through the
``django-cookie-consent`` package. If that package is installed, this
feature will automatically be enabled. When enabeld, your Tethys Portal users
will be prompted to consent to cookies when visiting the site for the first
time, or after cookies have been updated.

Cookie Categories
=================

There are four main categories that cookie usage can fall under:

- **Necessary.** These are essential for core functionality and cannot be opted out of.
  They are presented only for transparency.
- **Preferences.** These cookies remember choices that users make (such as language or 
  region) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. They can be opted out of.
- **Analytics.** These cookies collect information about how visitors use the site, such as 
  which pages are visited most often. They help improve the site and can be opted out of.
- **Marketing.** These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to your 
  users and their interests. They can be opted out of.

The cookies used natively by Tethys Portal are already configured out of the box
to be presented for user consent. Tethys Applications, however, must explicitly 
declare the cookies they use so that Tethys Portal can read that info and pass it 
along to users for their consent.

Declaring Cookies Used By Apps
==============================

Cookies used by an app must be declared and documented in a ``cookies.yaml`` file
that is stored in the app's Python package root's ``resources`` folder. You will
need to create the folder as well if it does not already exist.

For example:

::

    tethysapp-example-app  - App project root
    └── tethysapp/example_app/ - Python package root
            └── resources/
                └── cookies.yaml

The structure of this file is described below.

YAML structure
--------------

The following top-level keys are supported in ``cookies.yaml``:

- ``necessary``
- ``preferences``
- ``analytics``
- ``marketing``

These represent the four different categories that cookie usage can fall under, as described in the
:ref:`cookie_consent` section above. 
Any top-level key not in this list will cause the loader to raise an error when synchronizing 
cookies with the portal.

Each category included must contain a mapping of cookie identifiers to cookie properties.
The cookie identifier is used as the internal name for the cookie and should
be unique within its category. The cookie propertis are as follows:

- ``description`` — A short human-readable description of the cookie.
- ``path`` — The cookie path (e.g. ``/``).
- ``domain`` — The cookie domain (may be an empty string if not applicable).

Example
-------

An example ``cookies.yaml`` that declares one analytics cookie and a couple
of necessary cookies::

    analytics:
      ga:
        description: "Google Analytics tracking cookie"
        path: "/"
        domain: "example.com"

    necessary:
      sessionid:
        description: "Keeps the user logged in while navigating the site."
        path: "/"
        domain: ""

      csrftoken:
        description: "Prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks."
        path: "/"
        domain: ""

Tips for developers
-------------------

- Keep cookie identifiers stable across releases so user consent remains
  associated with the same cookie.
- Use clear, non-technical descriptions so users can make informed choices.
- If your app stops using a cookie, remove it from ``cookies.yaml`` — the
  synchronization process will remove it from the portal.

How synchronization works
-------------------------

When the portal synchronizes cookies for an app it:

1. Loads the ``cookies.yaml`` file from the app ``resources`` directory.
2. Creates, updates, or deletes cookies in the database to reflect the 
   YAML definition.

This synchronization runs at server startup, meaning that the server must
be restarted to pick up changes to these ``cookies.yaml`` files.

Conditionally Using Cookies Based On Consent
============================================

While the ``cookies.yaml`` file is sufficient to document the cookies an app
uses to users and allow them to accept or reject them, an app developer is
still responsible for honoring the consent that users dictate.

Assuming that some users will reject some cookies, there must be logic built
into the application to only use the cookies that have been accepted.

The following sections document how to dynamically check for a user's
consent from within a Python request handler and an HTML template.

Checking for cookie consent in a Python request handler
-------------------------------------------------------

To check from within a Python request function if consent has been given to use a non-essential 
category of cookies for an app (e.g. an app's "analytical" cookies), add the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from cookie_consent.util import get_cookie_value_from_request

    def home(request):
        has_consent = get_cookie_value_from_request(request, "<app_package>__<cookie_category>")
        if has_consent:
            # add cookie

Where ``<app_package>`` is the common identifier used for your application (as defined in
the ``app.py``'s ``App`` class), and ``<cookie_category>`` is one of: ``"analytics"``, 
``"preferences"``, or ``"marketing"`` (whichever the cookie of interest belongs to).


Checking for cookie consent in an HTML template
-----------------------------------------------

To check from within an HTML template if consent has been given to use a non-essential 
category of cookies for an app (e.g. an app's "marketing" cookies), add the following:

.. code-block:: html

    {% load cookie_consent_tags %}
    {% if request|cookie_group_accepted:"<app_package>__<cookie_category>" %}
    {# load 3rd party analytics #}
    {% endif %}

Where ``<app_package>`` is the common identifier used for your application (as defined in
the ``app.py``'s ``App`` class), and ``<cookie_category>`` is one of: ``"analytics"``, 
``"preferences"``, or ``"marketing"`` (whichever the cookie of interest belongs to).
