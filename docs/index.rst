Tethys is a platform that can be used to develop and host environmental web apps. It includes a suite of free and open source software (FOSS) that has been carefully selected to address the unique development needs of water resources web apps. Tethys web apps are developed using a Python software development kit (SDK) which includes programmatic links to each software component. Tethys Platform is powered by the Django Python web framework giving it a solid web foundation with excellent security and performance.
