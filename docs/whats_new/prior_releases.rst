Prior Release Notes
*******************

**Last Updated:** May 2023

Information about prior releases is shown here.


Release 4.3
===========

Django 4/5 Support
------------------

* Tethys Platform 4.3 is compatible with Django versions 4.2 - 5.x. It is now recommended to explicitly specify the version of Django that you want when you create your tethys environment.

See: :ref:`development_installation`

New Logo
--------

* The new logo design that is on the `Tethys Platform <https://www.tethysplatform.org/>`_ website is now in the default configuration of the Tethys Portal.

Single App Mode
---------------

* Tethys can now be used to deploy just a single app by setting the new `MULTIPLE_APP_MODE` setting to `False`.

See: :ref:`tethys_portal_config_settings`

Paths API
---------

* The new Paths API replaces the Workspaces API (which will still be supported until version 5.0) and provides access to the new Media directories and the App Resources directory. It also makes better use of the Python `pathlib` library.

See: :ref:`tethys_paths_api`

Async Support for the Jobs Table Gizmo
--------------------------------------

* Jobs Table actions callbacks are now asynchronous enabling them to run without blocking the webserver. Custom actions can also be `async`.

See: :ref:`jobs-table`

For a full list of changes in version 4.3 refer to `<https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys/releases/tag/4.3.0>`_


Release 4.2
===========

Python 3.12
-----------

* Verified Tethys Platform works using Python 3.12

Conda Forge Package
-------------------

* Tethys Platform is now fully packaged on conda-forge!

See: :ref:`development_installation`

Optional Dependencies and Micro Tethys
--------------------------------------

* Made many of the dependencies of ``tethys-platform`` optional and released new ``micro-tethys-platform`` conda package on the ``tethysplatform`` channel with minimal dependencies
* Updated docs to reflect what features are now optional and what dependencies are needed to support those features

.. note::

    The ``tethys-platform`` conda package for version 4.2 will still install all of the optional dependencies for backwards compatibility. Starting with Tethys version 5.0 the ``tethys-platform`` package will only have required dependencies. The ``micro-tethys-platform`` package, available on the ``tethysplatform`` channel, will install only the required dependencies allowing for a smaller Tethys environment.

See: :ref:`optional_features`, :ref:`development_installation`

Map Layout
----------

* Add labeling support for geojson features in MapLayout and MapView Gizmo.

* Includes the latest security updates.

See: `Django Supported Versions <https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions>`_

Python 3 Only
-------------

* Tethys Platform no longer supports Python 2.
* This is in large part because Django no longer supports Python 2 as of version 2.0.
* Python 2 is also reaching its `end of life in 2020 <https://pythonclock.org/>`_ (supposedly).

See: `Automated Python 2 to 3 code translation <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/2to3.html>`_ and `Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity? <https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3>`_

Upgraded JQuery and Bootstrap
-----------------------------

* The JQuery and Bootstrap libraries that Tethys provides were upgraded to address known security vulnerabilities (see: https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/bootstrap/3.2.0 and https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/jquery/1.11.1).
* Bootstrap has been upgraded to version 3.4.1 (not 4 yet, sorry).
* Coincidentally, JQuery was also upgraded to version 3.4.1.

Django Channels
---------------

* Tethys comes with `Django Channels <https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
* Django Channels wraps the synchronous Django process in an asynchronous process, allowing developers to use modern web protocols like WebSockets.

------------

* Documentation for Tethys ``url_maps`` and ``UrlMap`` has been added. This includes a description of the newly added ``UrlMap`` parameters with ``Websockets`` and ``Bokeh Integration``.

Django Analytical
-----------------

* Tethys comes with `Django Analytical <https://django-analytical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ installed to enable support form a number of analytics and tracking services.
* You can now enable analytics tracking (e.g. Google Analytics) to every page of your apps and portal with a few settings in the settings file.

See: :doc:`../installation/production/manual/configuration/advanced/webanalytics`

Tethys Quotas
-------------

* Tethys Quotas allow portal administrators to have better control over the resources being used by users and apps (e.g. disk storage).
* Tethys ships with quotas for workspace storage implemented, but it is disabled by default. When enabled, portal administrators can set limits on the storage users or apps are able to use.
* Tethys Quotas are completely extensible, allowing developer to create custom quotas for other resources (e.g. memory usage, database storage, wall time hours, etc.).

See: :doc:`../tutorials/quotas` and :doc:`../tethys_sdk/tethys_quotas`

Workspace Storage Management Pages
----------------------------------

* The User Profile now includes a page for managing storage in the user's workspace accross all apps in the portal. Users can choose to clear the storage in their workspace for an app.
* The App Settings page now includes information about storage in the app's workspace and provides a method for clearing that workspace.
* New endpoints on the App class allow app developers to respond to requests to clear storage from users.

See: :ref:`admin_pages_tethys_quotas`

New Portal Configuration File
-----------------------------

* Tethys will now use a new configuration file: ``portal_config.yml``
* The ``portal_config.yml`` will store information about which services should be used for installed apps and the portal settings
* Tethys Portal settings will now be configured in the new ``portal_config.yml`` file, rather than the ``settings.py``
* This will allow for the local settings to be retained when Tethys is updated in the future (no more regenerating the ``settings.py`` file when you update).
* Site settings will also be able to be configured via the ``portal_config.yml`` (e.g. primary color, logo, home page content).

See:

``tethys db`` command
---------------------

* The CLI has a new command for managing the Tethys database.
* It includes subcommands for initializing the tethys database, starting and stopping the local database, migrating the database between releases, and creating the tethys superuser.

See: :ref:`tethys_db_cmd`

Updated the ``tethys docker`` command
-------------------------------------

* The ``tethys docker`` command now uses the latest version of the Docker Python API.

See: :ref:`tethys_cli_docker`

Extended Services and Link Commands
-----------------------------------

* The ``tethys services`` command has been extended to support creating all Tethys services programatically.
* The ``tethys link`` command has been extended to support link all types of Tethys services to applicable App Settings programatically.

* The CLI has a new command for installing apps: `tethys install`.

See: :doc:`../installation/application`, :ref:`tethys_install_yml`, :ref:`tethys_services_yml`, and :ref:`Install Command <tethys_cli_install>`


New App Installation Approach
-----------------------------

* The structure of apps and the way they are installed has changed.
