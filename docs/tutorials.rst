Use the following tutorials to learn the basics about Tethys Platform.

Getting Started
===============

Start here if you are new to Tethys Platform and you want to learn how to develop apps. 

There are now two core development paradigms that you can learn and leverage: **Standard** or **Component**

:ref:`key_concepts_tutorial`
----------------------------

Closely follows Django's traditional web development framework. Your app will contain Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and you will need to learn at least some basics in all of these languages as you make edits to all these file types.

:ref:`component_app_basics_tutorial`
------------------------------------

Closely follows ReactPy's component-based web development framework (which is ReactJS's framework, but in pure Python). Your app will contain one or more Python files, and nothing more. You may still need to learn some basics of HTML and CSS as you translate some of their functionality to Python.
