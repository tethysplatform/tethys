Refer to this article for information about each new release of Tethys Platform.

Release 1.4.0
=============

App Permissions
---------------

* There is now a formalized mechanism for creating permissions for apps.
* It includes a `permission_required` decorator for controllers and a `has_permission` method for checking permissions within controllers.

See: :doc:`tethys_sdk/permissions`

Tags for Apps
-------------

* Apps can be assigned tags via the "tags" property in app.py.
* App tags can be overriden by portal admins using the ``Installed Apps`` settings in the admin portal.
* If there are more than 5 app tiles in the apps library, a list of buttons, one for each tag, will be displayed at the top of the Apps Library page.
* Clicking on one of the tag buttons, will filter the list of displayed apps to only those with the selected tag.

Terms and Conditions Management
-------------------------------

* Portal Admins can now manage and enforce portal-wide terms and conditions and other legal documents.
* Documents are added via the admin interface of the portal.
* Documents can be versioned and dates at which they become active can be set.
* Once the date passes, all users will be prompted to accept the terms of the new documents.

See: :ref:`tethys_portal_terms_and_conditions`

GeoServer
---------

* The GeoServer docker was updated to version 2.8.3
* It can be configured to run in clustered mode (multiple instances of GeoServer running inside the container) for greater stability and performance
* Several extensions are now included:

   * `JMS Clustering <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.8.x/en/user/community/jms-cluster/index.html>`_
   * `Flow Control <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.8.x/en/user/extensions/css/index.html>`_
   * `CSS Styles <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.8.x/en/user/extensions/controlflow/index.html>`_
   * `NetCDF <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.8.x/en/user/extensions/netcdf/netcdf.html>`_
   * `NetCDF Output <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.8.x/en/user/extensions/netcdf-out/index.html>`_
   * `GDAL WCS Output <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.8.x/en/user/community/gdal/index.html>`_

See: :doc:`software_suite/geoserver`

Tethys Docker CLI
-----------------

* Modified behaviour of "-c" option to accept a list of containers names so that commands can be performed on subsets of the containers
* Improved behaviour of "start" and "stop" commands such that they will start/stop all installed containers if some are not installed
* Improved behaviour of the "remove" command to skip containers that are not installed

See: :ref:`tethys_cli_docker`

Select2 Gizmo
-------------

* Updated the Select2 Gizmo libraries to version 4.0.
* Not changes should be necessary for basic usage of the Select2 Gizmo.
* If you are using advanced features of Select2, you will likely need to migrate some of your code.
* Refer to `<https://select2.github.io/announcements-4.0.html#migrating-from-select2-35>`_ for migration help.

See: :doc:`tethys_sdk/gizmos/select_input`

MapView Gizmo
-------------

* New JavaScript API endpoints for the MapView.
* Use the `TETHYS_MAP_VIEW.getSelectInteraction()` method to have more control over items that are selected.
* MVLayer Select Features now supports selection of vector layers in addition to the WMS Layers.
* Added support for images in the legend including support for GeoServer GetLegendGraphic requests.

See: :doc:`tethys_sdk/gizmos/map_view`

PlotView Gizmo
--------------

* New JavaScript API endpoints for initializing PlotViews dynamically.

See: :doc:`tethys_sdk/gizmos/plot_view`


Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed an issue with URL mapping that was masking true errors with contollers (see: `Issue #177 <https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys/issues/177>`_
* Fixed an issue with syncstores that use the string version of the path to the intializer function (see: `Issue #185 <https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys/issues/185>`_)
