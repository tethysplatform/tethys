Configure Map Layout Data Plotting
**********************************

**Last Updated:** July 2024

In this tutorial you will configure data plotting for your Tethys Map Layout that will allow users to click on features on your map and plot data associated with them.

0. Start From Previous Solution (Optional)
==========================================

If you wish to use the previous solution as a starting point:

.. parsed-literal::

    git clone https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethysapp-map_layout_tutorial
    cd tethysapp-map_layout_tutorial
    git checkout -b add-spatial-data-solution add-spatial-data-solution-|version|

You'll also need to do the following:

1. Download the solution version of the sample NextGen data used in this tutorial: `sample_nextgen_data_solution.zip <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HA6fF_EdGtiE5ceKF0wH2H8GDElMA3zM/view?usp=share_link>`_.
2. Save to :file:`$TETHYS_HOME/workspaces/map_layout_tutorial/app_workspace`
3. Unzip the contents to the same location
4. Delete the zip file
5. Rename the :file:`sample_nextgen_data_solution` to :file:`sample_nextgen_data` (i.e. remove "_solution")

1. Configure NextGen Data Plotting
==================================

We want to be able to wire up our application to easily explore and view the NextGen CSV outputs that we explored in a previous section. With the ``MapLayoutTutorialMap`` class we've been exploring, this is not too complicated.

To get basic plotting to work for the ouput NextGen data associated with the nexus points and catchments we've spatially added to our map, we simply need to override the ``get_plot_for_layer_feature`` function, copying its expected signatures (i.e. arguments) and returning the expected result. Let's take a look at what a functional, complete implementation will look like and then dive into the details.

Replace :file:`controller.py` with the following:

Let's take a closer look at what has changed.

1. There is a new import: `pandas`

This is the one third-party library that we added to our :file:`install.yml` in the first section of this tutorial. We will need this package to read in and handle the CSV NextGen outputs.

2. A new constant is defined after the imports: 

.. code-block::python 
    
    MODEL_OUTPUT_FOLDER_NAME = 'sample_nextgen_data'

This references the folder within the :file:`app_workspace` directory that serves as the root folder for the NextGen model output. This was changed to a constant since it will now be referenced in multiple places: both where the spatial data is accessed and now where the tabular data will be accessed.

Note that this constant is now used on the relevant line in the ``compose_layers`` function:

.. code-block::python

    config_directory = Path(app_workspace.path) / MODEL_OUTPUT_FOLDER_NAME / 'config'

3. Two new properties are defined in the ``MapLayoutTutorialMap`` class:

.. code-block:: python

    class MapLayoutTutorialMap(MapLayout):
        ...
        ...
        ...
        show_properties_popup = True
        plot_slide_sheet = True

The must be explicitly defined since they default to ``False``. Here's what they do:

* **show_properties_popup**: Wires up a properties dialog that will now popup automatically when clicking on a feature and display the ``properties`` metadata associated with the feature as defined in the GeoJSON file. This will only apply to features that were configured with ``selectable = True``, as we did with our NextGen layers in the last section.
* **plot_slide_sheet**: Adds a ``Plot`` button to the properties dialog described in the line above and wire up the button to call the ``get_plot_for_features`` function when clicked (this function is discussed next). This will only apply to features that were configured with ``plottable = True``, as we did with our NextGen layers in the last section.

With just those two lines added, the popup generated when clicking on a featuer will look like this:

.. figure:: ./resources/popup_example.png
    :width: 800px
    :align: center

4. The ``get_plot_for_features`` function was added

Here's a closer look at that function:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_plot_for_layer_feature(self, request, layer_name, feature_id, layer_data, feature_props, app_workspace,
                                    *args, **kwargs):
            """

                feature_id (str): ID of feature.
                layer_data (dict): The MVLayer.data dictionary.
                feature_props (dict): The properties of the selected feature.

            Returns:
                str, list<dict>, dict: plot title, data series, and layout options, respectively.
            """
            output_directory = Path(app_workspace.path) / MODEL_OUTPUT_FOLDER_NAME / 'output'

            # Get the feature id
            id = feature_props.get('id')

            # Nexus
            if layer_name == 'nexus':
                layout = {

                }

                output_path = output_directory / f'{id}_output.csv'
                if not output_path.exists():
                    print(f'WARNING: no such file {output_path}')

                    }
                }

                output_path = output_directory / f'{id}.csv'
                if not output_path.exists():

                            'color': 'red'
                        }
                    },
                ]

                return f'Evapotranspiration at Catchment "{id}"', data, layout


This function is passed six standard arguments: ``request``, ``layer_name``, ``feature_id``, ``layer_data``, ``feature_props``, and ``app_workspace``. In our case, we only need to use the ``layer_name``, ``feature_props``, and ``app_workspace`` variable. We'll describe how each is used as we explore what this function does.

This function does the following:

1. Composes the path to the :file:`outputs` folder where our NextGen tabular (CSV) data is stored. Note the use of the ``MODEL_OUTPUT_FOLDER_NAME`` constant.
2. Uses the ``feature_props`` argument (that is passed in when the ``Plot`` button is clicked) to extract the ``id`` of the specific feature clicked. This comes from the ``properties`` metadata associated with the feature as defined in the GeoJSON file.
3. Uses the ``layer_name`` argument to distinguish between the "nexus" and "catchment" layers. This will match the same value chosen when configuring the layer with the ``build_geojson_layer`` function, as we did in the previous section.
4. For each layer, whether "nexus" or "catchment", the code handles the following:
    a. Define the ``layout`` variable - one of the expected return values - which in this case is used only to define the y-axis label.
    b. Compose the exact path to the selected feature's corresponding tabular data. For nexus data it should be a file named :file:`<nexID>_output.csv` and for catchment data it should be a file named :file:`<catID>.csv` as was discovered and discussed in the Data Prep section.
    c. Check if the tabular file actually exists, and if not return an appropriate message (i.e. chart title), data (in this case, none or ``[]``), and the defined ``layout``.
    d. If the file exists, it is opened using the ``read_csv`` method of ``pandas``
    e. Then, the separate columns of data that are desired for the plot axes are separated out into distinct variables using the ``iloc`` accessor of pandas, where the provided integer represents the 0-based column number. These can be confirmed by manually opening inspecting the CSV files. 
       For the nexus data, we want "Time" (column 1) on the x-axis and Streamflow (column 2) on the y-axis. Note that we also convert Streamflow from CMS to CFS.
       For the catchment data, we want "Time" (column 1) on the x-axis and Evapotranspiration (column 2)
    f. The structured ``data`` variable is composed: a dictionary with the following keys: ``name``, ``mode``, ``x``, ``y``, and ``line``, where ``line`` has its own dictionary defining its ``width`` and ``color``.
       These values can be played with to achieve the look and feel that you desire.
    g. Finally, the expected data is returned: the title of the plot, the data to plot (``data`` variable) and the plot display properties (``layout``)

With this code all wired up, you can now click the ``Plot`` button on the popup for any feature, and assuming the tabular data exists for that feature (and it should), then a plot will slide into view that displays the corresponding model output data for that feature. It should look something like the figure at the top of this section.

There you have it! With less than 200 lines of code, we have quickly developed a useful data viewer for the NextGen model.

5. Solution
===========

This concludes the Configure Data Plotting portion of the Map Layout Tutorial. You can view the solution on GitHub at `<https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethysapp-map_layout_tutorial/tree/configure-data-plotting-solution>`_ or clone it as follows:

.. parsed-literal::

    git clone https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethysapp-map_layout_tutorial
    cd tethysapp-map_layout_tutorial
    git checkout -b configure-data-plotting configure-data-plotting-|version|
