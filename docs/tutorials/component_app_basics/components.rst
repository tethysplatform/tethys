Components and Component-Based Development
******************************************

Let's take a look at the concept of components and how component-based development can help you build modular, reusable, and maintainable applications.


In this tutorial, you will learn:

- What components are and why they are useful
- How to create and use components in your application
- Best practices for component-based development

Let's get started!

Components
==========

A **component** is a self-contained unit of functionality that directly represents a visual object rendered on a web page. 
These can be as simple or as complex as needed, ranging from buttons and input fields to interactive maps and data tables.
No matter the complexity, each component encapsulates its own logic, structure, and styling. 

The core idea, however, is that complex components can be built from simpler ones. 
By composing components together, you can create sophisticated user interfaces while keeping each part of your codebase focused and manageable.

In Tethys, components are implemented as Python functions that generate the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web interface. Tethys Platform provides access to a vast amount of pre-built components via its :ref:`tethys_components_library` and makes it easy to add additional ReactJS comopnent libraries that are not already included.

Apps and Pages as Components
----------------------------

Apps and Pages can be thought of as components themselves, where an App component consists of one or more Page components. Each Page component, in turn, is composed of smaller UI components such as buttons, maps, and tables. This hierarchical structure allows you to build complex applications by assembling and nesting components at different levels.

The Content Tree
----------------

This hierarchical relationship between components and the components that they are composed of will be referred throughout this tutorial as a **content tree**.

The content tree for new app project you created in the past steps conceptually looks like this:

- App
    - Page
        - Header
        - HamburgerIcon
        - Icon
        - AppTitle
        - SettingsIcon
        - ExitIcon
    - NavigationPanel
        - NavLink
    - Content
        - Display
            - Map

The Page Component
------------------

By decorating a function with the ``App.page`` decorator, you are adding another Page component to your App. 
Based on the settings in the ``App`` class, each Page comes pre-composed with a number of other components, such as a Header and a Navbar, and a Content component.

**This is where you come in: the developer.** You determine what is displayed in your app.
Whatever is returned by your page functions represents the component-based content that will be rendered when a user navigates to that page.

.. note::
    
    The ``App.page`` decorator also handles routing, so each decorated function is automatically mapped to a URL endpoint within your app. This makes it easy to add new pages by simply creating new functions and decorating them with ``App.page``.

Back to Development
===================

Let's take another look at the ``home`` page function of the app you created in the last steps.

.. code-block:: python
    
    @App.page
    def home(lib):
        return lib.tethys.Display(
            lib.tethys.Map()
        )

Code Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The content tree being returned by this function is a Display component that itself is composed of a Map component.

Note the following:

- The ``lib.tethys`` namespace is used to access the ``Display`` and ``Map`` components. There are other namespaced modules available on the ``lib`` object which we will introduce to you soon.
- The ``lib.tethys.Display`` component in this example is called with a single argument: the ``lib.tethys.Map`` component. Many components can nest other components, which renders them inside of the parent component. In this case, the ``lib.tethys.Map`` component is rendered inside of the ``lib.tethys.Display`` component, which is essentially just a special container for nesting other components.
- The ``lib.tethys.Map`` component in this example takes no arguments, so it will use the default settings which include a basic basemap and standard controls. Most components accept various keyword arguments to customize their behavior and appearance, which you will learn about in the next sections of this tutorial.

The Display component is quite a simple component, which itself is just made up of an HTML div - basically an empty container for holding other things.

The Map component, on the other hand, is quite complex. 
Right out of the box this component provides a fully interactive map interface with support for panning, zooming, multiple projections, and a variety of built-in controls such as layer toggles, scale lines, and full-screen mode. 
It is designed to be highly extensible, allowing you to add layers, controls, and event handlers to customize the map's behavior and appearance to fit your application's needs.

Enhancing Components with Nested Children
=========================================

You can further enhance the Map component by nesting additional children components, such as layers for displaying geospatial data, controls for user interaction, and popups for displaying information. 
This modular approach makes it easy to build powerful mapping interfaces without having to manage the low-level details yourself.

Adding Geospatial Data to the Map
---------------------------------

Let's enhance our Map component by adding geospatial data to it. This can be done by nesting a new Layer component within the Map.
This layer component will come from the ``lib.ol`` module (where ``ol`` refers to `OpenLayers <https://openlayers.org/>`_).

Geospatial data can come from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. For this tutorial, we are interested in adding the data hosted as an `ArcGIS REST Map Service <https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/map-service/>`_ here: https://livefeeds3.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/GEOGLOWS/GlobalWaterModel_Medium/MapServer.

To add an ArcGIS REST Map Service layer to your map, you'll use the ``lib.ol.layer.Image`` component, nesting it as a child of the ``lib.tethys.Map`` component, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    @App.page
    def home(lib):
        return lib.tethys.Display(
            lib.tethys.Map(
                lib.ol.layer.Image(title="GEOGLOWS Streamflow Service")(
                    lib.ol.source.ImageArcGISRest(
                        url='https://livefeeds3.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/GEOGLOWS/GlobalWaterModel_Medium/MapServer'
                    )
                )
            )
        )

Code Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``lib.ol`` module provides Pythonic access to `PlanetLabs' declarative component wrapper around OpenLayers <https://planetlabs.github.io/maps/>`_. 
This mouthful simply means that with ``lib.ol`` you are indirectly accessing much of the `OpenLayers <https://openlayers.org/>`_ API, but with Python!

.. note::

    You will be able to glean much about :ref:`tethys_components_html_jsx_to_python` through this hands-on tutorial, but you may want to visit that link for more direct and consolidated information.

The ``lib.ol.layer.Image`` component:

- Accepts a ``title`` keyword argument. The provided value will be displayed in the layer toggle that is automatically generated under the Map's layer control menu (see screenshot below)
- Requires a nested layer source component. Because we're adding an ArcGIS REST Map Server, we use the corresponding ``lib.ol.source.ImageArcGISRest`` component as the child of the Layer.

The ``lib.ol.source.ImageArcGISRest`` component:

- Accepts a ``url`` keyword argument. The provided value will of course be used to connect to the data feed and fetch our geospatial data of interest.

.. important::

    Note the nuanced difference in syntax between all of the components in the component tree returned by the ``home`` function.
    Props and children can be passed directly as kwargs or args, respectively, if the component only needs one or the other.
    If the component needs both, the kwargs get passed as direct arguments of the component function, while the children get passed as arguments to a second, chained call of the component function.
    
    ``Component(arg1="val1")`` 
    
    vs 
    
    ``Component(ChildComponent())``
    
    vs 
    
    ``Component(arg1="val1")(ChildComponent())``

Make sure you save the ``app.py`` file, which should automatically restart your server. 

Now return to the browser and refresh the page to view the rendered changes, which should look something like this:

.. note::

    The rendered geospatial data will likely look different since it's coming from a live service that updates frequently based on modeled environmental conditions.

    :align: center

    Layer Added to Map

Your map is now rendering geospatial data that represents modeled Streamflow across the globe.
If you click on the map's layer icon in the upper-left corner, it will expand out to a panel that displays the map's Layer Overlays - which now includes the "GEOGLOWS Streamflow Service" entry. You can toggle on/off the checkbox to show/hide the layer on the map.

Now that we have our geospatial data added to the map, it's natural to want to add additional interactivity to explore the data.

Our ultimate goal is that users can click on the map to pull up a chart that plots the actual forecast data associated with associated geospatial feature they selected.

The next step toward that end will be to add a side panel to the app that can display our chart.

Add a Panel with a Chart
========================

We should be able to move quickly through this section now that we're getting the hang of component-based App development.

In addition to the ``Display`` and ``Map`` components, the ``lib.tethys`` module also has both a ``Panel`` and ``Chart`` component that can quickly get us what we're looking for - a panel containing a chart!

Here's the new code:

.. code-block:: python

    @App.page
    def home(lib):
        return lib.tethys.Display(
            lib.tethys.Map(
                lib.ol.layer.Image(title="GEOGLOWS Streamflow Service")(
                    lib.ol.source.ImageArcGISRest(
                        url='https://livefeeds3.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/GEOGLOWS/GlobalWaterModel_Medium/MapServer'
                    )
                ),
            ),  # New code starts here
            lib.tethys.Panel(
                lib.tethys.Chart()
            )
        )

Much like the original ``Map`` component, no arguments are being passed to these components, which means they will render with their defaults.
That is fine for now.

Save the ``app.py`` and refresh your browser after the server automatically reloads. You should see something like the following:

.. figure:: ../../images/tutorial/component_app_basics/add_panel_chart.png
    :width: 800px
    :align: center

    Right Panel with Empty Chart

The panel renders by default anchored to the right edge of the page, overlaying the content below.
A couple of important things to point out:

- The panel has an "X" icon in the top right that will close the panel upon click. Great, right? But there's currently no way of pulling it back up... Remember, our goal is to pull it up by click a feature on the map.
- The chart does not look at all like a chart. It's currently more of a placeholder for a chart. This is because we haven't added data to it. Remember, we plan for that same map click to initiate a process that fetches the relevant data and adds it to the chart.

If you hadn't guessed, our next step will be adding some additional interactivity to the app by triggering updates with a map click. Let's get to it!
