Quotas Concepts
***************

**Last Updated:** July 2024

This tutorial introduces Tethys Quotas API concepts for Tethys developers. The topics covered include:

* Workspace Quotas
* Creating custom quotas
* Enforcing quotas
* Managing quotas
* Extended concepts from previous tutorials


0. Start From Advanced Solution (Optional)
==========================================

If you wish to use the advanced solution as a starting point:

.. parsed-literal::

    git clone https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethysapp-dam_inventory.git
    cd tethysapp-dam_inventory
    git checkout -b advanced-solution advanced-|version|

1. Workspace Quotas
===================

In the :ref:`key_concepts_advanced_tutorial` tutorial we refactored the Model to use an SQL database, rather than files. However, we might want to store some data as files in case we want to export them later. This will also allow us to demonstrate the use of the built-in workspace quotas that come with the :doc:`../../tethys_sdk/tethys_quotas`.

a. Add the ``user_workspace`` argument to the ``controller`` decorator and a ``user_workspace`` argument to the ``assign_hydrograph`` controller. Write the hydrograph CSV with the dam id prepended to the filename to the user's workspace. The prepended id will be used later when handling a user deleting a dam they have created.

    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 1, 5-6, 44-59

        import os

        ...

        @controller(url='hydrographs/assign', user_workspace=True)
        def assign_hydrograph(request, user_workspace):
            """
            Controller for the Add Hydrograph page.
            """
            # Get dams from database
            Session = App.get_persistent_store_database('primary_db', as_sessionmaker=True)
            session = Session()
            all_dams = session.query(Dam).all()

            # Defaults
            dam_select_options = [(dam.name, dam.id) for dam in all_dams]
            selected_dam = None
            hydrograph_file = None

            # Errors
            dam_select_errors = ''
            hydrograph_file_error = ''

            # Case where the form has been submitted
            if request.POST and 'add-button' in request.POST:
                # Get Values
                has_errors = False
                selected_dam = request.POST.get('dam-select', None)

                if not selected_dam:
                    has_errors = True
                    dam_select_errors = 'Dam is Required.'

                # Get File
                if request.FILES and 'hydrograph-file' in request.FILES:
                    # Get a list of the files
                    hydrograph_file = request.FILES.getlist('hydrograph-file')

                if not hydrograph_file and len(hydrograph_file) > 0:
                    has_errors = True
                    hydrograph_file_error = 'Hydrograph File is Required.'

                if not has_errors:
                    # Process file here
                    hydrograph_file = hydrograph_file[0]
                    success = assign_hydrograph_to_dam(selected_dam, hydrograph_file)

                    # Remove csv related to dam if exists
                    for file in os.listdir(user_workspace.path):
                        if file.startswith("{}_".format(selected_dam)):
                            os.remove(os.path.join(user_workspace.path, file))

                    # Write csv to user_workspace to test workspace quota functionality
                    full_filename = "{}_{}".format(selected_dam, hydrograph_file.name)
                    with open(os.path.join(user_workspace.path, full_filename), 'wb+') as destination:
                        for chunk in hydrograph_file.chunks():
                            destination.write(chunk)
                        destination.close()

                    # Provide feedback to user
                    if success:
                        messages.info(request, 'Successfully assigned hydrograph.')
                    else:
                        messages.info(request, 'Unable to assign hydrograph. Please try again.')
                    return App.redirect(App.reverse('home'))

                messages.error(request, "Please fix errors.")

        ...

b. Go to the :ref:`tethys_quotas_resource_quota` section of the admin pages and edit the ``User Workspace Quota`` as follows (must be done on administrator account):

* Default - ``2e-07`` (measured in GB so this converts to 214 bytes which allows for storing about 2 hydrographs to test the quota)
* Active - ``Enabled``
* Impose default - ``Enabled``

c. Update your tethys portal settings by running the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        tethys settings --set USE_OLD_WORKSPACES_API False

    .. note::
        
        The ``USE_OLD_WORKSPACES_API`` setting is set to ``True`` by default. The workspaces quota requires this setting to match the API version used by the app. Since you're using the newer workspaces API, you need to set this to ``False``.
        
        If you're on Tethys 5+, you can skip this step as the new workspace API is used by default.

d. To test:

    a. assign ``hydrograph2.csv`` and ``hydrograph4.csv`` (from :ref:`Sample Hydrographs <sample_hydrographs>`) to two separate dams through the app
    b. try to assign a third hydrograph (all of this must be done on a non-administrator account). 
    c. You should get an error page that advises you to visit the storage management pages and clean workspaces. 
    d. Do this now (see :ref:`tethys_quotas_user_manage` for help) and try again to assign a hydrograph. 
    e. Because your user workspace is clear you should be able to assign another hydrograph.

.. note::

    Quotas are not enforced on administrator users (i.e. staff/superusers). To manage quotas, login as administrator, but to test them, login as a normal user.

2. Clear Workspace Handler
==========================

Now that hydrograph files are stored to the user's workspace and the user can clear said workspace through their settings page, we will want to do some extra processing when they actually do clear their workspace. If the user deletes their hydrograph files we also want to remove the related hydrographs from the database.

a. First add ``user_id = Column(Integer)`` as a column in the Dam model class. Also add ``cascade="all,delete"`` as an argument to the ``hydrograph`` relationship in the ``Dam`` model class and the ``points`` relationship in the ``Hydrograph`` model class.

    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 15, 18, 33

        class Dam(Base):
            """
            SQLAlchemy Dam DB Model
            """
            __tablename__ = 'dams'

            # Columns
            id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
            latitude = Column(Float)
            longitude = Column(Float)
            name = Column(String)
            owner = Column(String)
            river = Column(String)
            date_built = Column(String)
            user_id = Column(Integer)

            # Relationships
            hydrograph = relationship('Hydrograph', cascade="all,delete", back_populates='dam', uselist=False)


        class Hydrograph(Base):
            """
            SQLAlchemy Hydrograph DB Model
            """
            __tablename__ = 'hydrographs'

            # Columns
            id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
            dam_id = Column(ForeignKey('dams.id'))

            # Relationships
            dam = relationship('Dam', back_populates='hydrograph')
            points = relationship('HydrographPoint', cascade="all,delete", back_populates='hydrograph')

    .. note::

        Adding ``cascade="all,delete"`` as an argument in an sqlalchemey model relationship causes the deletion of related records to be handled automatically. In this case, if hydrograph is removed from the database the hydrograph's points will also be deleted and if a dam is removed the connected hydrograph and its points will be removed.

b. Then modify the ``add_new_dam`` function like so:

    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 1, 19

        def add_new_dam(location, name, owner, river, date_built, user_id):
            """
            Persist new dam.
            """
            # Convert GeoJSON to Python dictionary
            location_dict = json.loads(location)
            location_geometry = location_dict['geometries'][0]
            longitude = location_geometry['coordinates'][0]
            latitude = location_geometry['coordinates'][1]

            # Create new Dam record
            new_dam = Dam(
                latitude=latitude,
                longitude=longitude,
                name=name,
                owner=owner,
                river=river,
                date_built=date_built,
                user_id=user_id
            )

            ...

c. Add ``user_id=-1`` when initializing ``dam1`` and ``dam2`` in the ``init_primary_db`` function.

    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 13, 23

        def init_primary_db(engine, first_time):

            ...

                # Initialize database with two dams
                dam1 = Dam(
                    latitude=40.406624,
                    longitude=-111.529133,
                    name="Deer Creek",
                    owner="Reclamation",
                    river="Provo River",
                    date_built="April 12, 1993",
                    user_id=-1
                )

                dam2 = Dam(
                    latitude=40.598168,
                    longitude=-111.424055,
                    name="Jordanelle",
                    owner="Reclamation",
                    river="Provo River",
                    date_built="1941",
                    user_id=-1
                )

                ...

d. Then make the following changes to the ``add_dam`` controller:

    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 11

        @controller(url='dams/add', permissions_required='add_dams')
        def add_dam(request):
            """
            Controller for the Add Dam page.
            """
            ...

                    # Only add the dam if custom setting doesn't exist or we have not exceed max_dams
                    if not max_dams or num_dams < max_dams:
                        add_new_dam(location=location, name=name, owner=owner, river=river,
                                    date_built=date_built, user_id=request.user.id)
                    else:

            ...

e. The changes that have been made to the model require us to drop the database tables for the Dam Inventory app and recreate them. Run the ``tethys syncstores`` command with the ``--refresh`` option to do this:

    .. code-block:: bash

        tethys syncstores --refresh dam_inventory

f. Modify the ``assign_hydrograph`` controller again, this time to only allow users to assign hydrographs to dams that they have created.

    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 9

        @controller(url='hydrographs/assign', user_workspace=True)
        def assign_hydrograph(request, user_workspace):
            """
            Controller for the Add Hydrograph page.
            """
            # Get dams from database
            Session = App.get_persistent_store_database('primary_db', as_sessionmaker=True)
            session = Session()
            all_dams = session.query(Dam).filter(Dam.user_id == request.user.id)

        ...

g. Finally, add the ``pre_delete_user_workspace`` method to the app class in :file:`app.py` (see :doc:`../../tethys_sdk/tethys_quotas` for more details):

    .. code-block:: python

        class App(TethysAppBase):
            """
            Tethys app class for Dam Inventory.
            """
            ...
    
            @classmethod
            def pre_delete_user_workspace(cls, user):
                from .model import Dam
                Session = cls.get_persistent_store_database('primary_db', as_sessionmaker=True)
                session = Session()

                # Delete all hydrographs connected to dams created by user
                dams = session.query(Dam).filter(Dam.user_id == user.id)

                for dam in dams:
                    if dam.hydrograph:
                        session.delete(dam.hydrograph)

                session.commit()
                session.close()

h. Finally, remove the permissions restrictions on adding dams so that any user can add dams.

    controllers.py:

    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 1

        @controller(url='dams/add')
        def add_dam(request):
            """
            Controller for the Add Dam page.
            """
            ...

    Replace the contents of the app_navigation_items block in ``base.html`` with the following:

    .. code-block:: html+django

        {% block app_navigation_items %}
        {% url tethys_app|url:'home' as home_url %}
        {% url tethys_app|url:'add_dam' as add_dam_url %}
        {% url tethys_app|url:'dams' as list_dam_url %}
        {% url tethys_app|url:'assign_hydrograph' as assign_hydrograph_url %}
        <li class="nav-item title">Navigation</li>
        <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link{% if request.path == home_url %} active{% endif %}" href="{{ home_url }}">Home</a></li>
        <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link{% if request.path == list_dam_url %} active{% endif %}" href="{{ list_dam_url }}">Dams</a></li>
        <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link{% if request.path == add_dam_url %} active{% endif %}" href="{{ add_dam_url }}">Add Dam</a></li>
        <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link{% if request.path == assign_hydrograph_url %} active{% endif %}" href="{{ assign_hydrograph_url }}">Assign Hydrograph</a></li>
        {% endblock %}

    Add a template file named ``home.html`` and add the following contents:

    .. code-block:: html+django

        {% block app_actions %}
            {% gizmo add_dam_button %}
        {% endblock %}

3. Custom Dam Quota
===================

With the changes we made to the Dam model, we can now associate each dam with the user who created it and track how many dams each user created. In this part of the tutorial we will create a custom quota to restrict the number of dams a user can create. This will effectively replace the work we did in previous tutorials with the custom setting, ``max_dams``. Instead of limiting the number of dams for the whole app through a custom setting we will restrict it per user with a custom quota.

a. Creating a custom quota is pretty simple. Create a new file called ``dam_quota_handler.py`` and add the following contents:

    .. code-block:: python

        from tethys_quotas.handlers.base import ResourceQuotaHandler
        from .model import Dam
        from .app import App


        class DamQuotaHandler(ResourceQuotaHandler):
            """
            Defines quotas for dam storage for the persistent store.

            inherits from ResourceQuotaHandler
            """
            codename = "dam_quota"
            name = "Dam Quota"
            description = "Set quota on dam db entry storage for persistent store."
            default = 3  # number of dams that can be created per user
            units = "dam"
            help = "You have exceeded your quota on dams. Please visit the dams page and remove unneeded dams."
            applies_to = ["django.contrib.auth.models.User"]

            def get_current_use(self):
                """
                calculates/retrieves the current number of dams in the database

                Returns:
                    Int: current number of dams in database
                """
                # Query database for count of dams
                Session = App.get_persistent_store_database('primary_db', as_sessionmaker=True)
                session = Session()
                current_use = session.query(Dam).filter(Dam.user_id == self.entity.id).count()

                session.close()

                return current_use

    .. note::

        See :ref:`tethys_quotas_rqh` for an explanation of the different parameters.

b. Now go into the portal's :file:`portal_config.yml` file and add the dot-path of the handler class you just created in the ``RESOURCE_QUOTA_HANDLERS`` array.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        settings:
          RESOURCE_QUOTA_HANDLERS:
            - tethysapp.dam_inventory.dam_quota_handler.DamQuotaHandler

c. Make sure the Tethys development server restarts by pressing ``CTRL-C`` and then running ``tethys manage start``.

d. After re-starting tethys the ``User Dam Quota`` should be visible in the ``Resource Quota`` section of the admin pages. Click on it and make sure `Active` and `Impose default` are both ``Enabled``.

    .. figure:: ../images/tutorial/quotas/ResourceQuotaView.png
        :width: 100%
        :align: center

e. Go into the app's settings page through the portal admin pages and delete the value for ``max_dams`` in the ``CUSTOM SETTINGS`` section. This will ensure that our custom quota is handling the amount of dams that can be added instead of the custom setting.

    .. figure:: ../images/tutorial/quotas/MaxDamsView.png
        :width: 100%
        :align: center

f. To enforce the new dam quota set the ``enforce_quotas`` argument on the ``controllers`` decorator and add it to the ``add_dam`` controller.

    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 1

        @controller(url='dams/add', enforce_quotas='user_dam_quota')
        def add_dam(request):
            """
            Controller for the Add Dam page.
            """
            ...

    .. note::

        We used the codename ``user_dam_quota`` instead of just ``dam_quota`` because Tethys Quotas appends what the quota ``applies_to`` (from the :ref:`tethys_quotas_rqh` class parameters) to the codename to differentiate between quotas on users or on apps.

        If we wanted to enforce our custom dam quota on an app as a whole we would need to add ``"tethys_apps.models.TethysApp"`` to the ``applies_to`` parameter in our ``DamQuotaHandler`` and then change the codename to ``tethysapp_dam_quota``.

g. You can now test this by logging into a non-administrator account and trying to create more than 3 dams. You should be taken to another error page telling you that you have reached the limit on dams you can create.

4. Dam Quota Management
=======================

As is, the app would never allow a user to add a new dam once the quota was reached unless the portal administrator changed the dam quota default value (or made the quota inactive) or removed dams created by that user from the database. We will now add a way for a user to remove dams they have created through the ``list_dams`` controller.

a. Create the ``delete_dam`` function in ``controllers.py``:

    .. code-block:: python

        @controller(url='dams/{dam_id}/delete', user_workspace=True)
        def delete_dam(request, user_workspace, dam_id):
            """
            Controller for the deleting a dam.
            """
            Session = App.get_persistent_store_database('primary_db', as_sessionmaker=True)
            session = Session()

            # Delete hydrograph file related to dam if exists
            for file in os.listdir(user_workspace.path):
                if file.startswith("{}_".format(int(dam_id))):
                    os.remove(os.path.join(user_workspace.path, file))

            # Delete dam object
            dam = session.query(Dam).get(int(dam_id))
            session.delete(dam)
            session.commit()
            session.close()

            messages.success(request, "{} Dam has been successfully deleted.".format(dam.name))

            return App.redirect(App.reverse('dams'))

d. Refactor the ``list_dams`` controller to add a `Delete` button for each dam. The code will restrict user's to deleting only dams that they created.

    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 18-23, 29, 34

        @controller(name='dams', url='dams')
        def list_dams(request):
            """
            Show all dams in a table view.
            """
            dams = get_all_dams()
            table_rows = []

            for dam in dams:
                hydrograph_id = get_hydrograph(dam.id)
                if hydrograph_id:
                    url = App.reverse('hydrograph', kwargs={'hydrograph_id': hydrograph_id})
                    dam_hydrograph = format_html('<a class="btn btn-primary" href="{}">Hydrograph Plot</a>'.format(url))
                else:
                    dam_hydrograph = format_html('<a class="btn btn-primary disabled" title="No hydrograph assigned" '
                                                 'style="pointer-events: auto;">Hydrograph Plot</a>')

                if dam.user_id == request.user.id:
                    url = App.reverse('delete_dam', kwargs={'dam_id': dam.id})
                    dam_delete = format_html('<a class="btn btn-danger" href="{}">Delete Dam</a>'.format(url))
                else:
                    dam_delete = format_html('<a class="btn btn-danger disabled" title="You are not the creator of this dam" '
                                             'style="pointer-events: auto;">Delete Dam</a>')

                table_rows.append(
                    (
                        dam.name, dam.owner,
                        dam.river, dam.date_built,
                        dam_hydrograph, dam_delete
                    )
                )

            dams_table = DataTableView(
                column_names=('Name', 'Owner', 'River', 'Date Built', 'Hydrograph', 'Manage'),
                rows=table_rows,
                searching=False,
                orderClasses=False,
                lengthMenu=[[10, 25, 50, -1], [10, 25, 50, "All"]],
            )

            context = {
                'dams_table': dams_table,
                'can_add_dams': has_permission(request, 'add_dams')
            }

            return App.render(request, 'list_dams.html', context)

e. Test by deleting a dam or two (while logged in as the non-administrator) and trying to add new dams. This time you shouldn't be redirected to the error page, but should be able to add a dam like normal because you brought the number of dams created by the current user below the quota's default value.
