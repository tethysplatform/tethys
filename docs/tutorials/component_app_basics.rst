This tutorial will teach you the basics of Tethys Component App development by walking you through the creation and development of a simple Component App using Tethys Platform. The finished app will be a GeoGlows API data viewer that enables a user to click on a map feature representing a river and generate a chart of the flow data associated with the clicked feature.
