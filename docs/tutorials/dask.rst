Dask Tutorial
*************

**Last Updated:** August 2024

This tutorial will walk you through the steps of working with Dask using the Tethys Platform. If you have not already installed Tethys Platform, follow the :doc:`../installation` documentation and then return.

You will need to use the command line/terminal to manage your app and run the development server. It is highly recommended that you read the :doc:`../../supplementary/terminal_quick_guide` article for some tips if you are new to command line before you get started.

The solution to this tutorial is available at: `<https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethysapp-dask_tutorial>`_
