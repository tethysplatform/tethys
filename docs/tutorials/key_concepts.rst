.. tip::

   If you have not already installed Tethys Platform, follow the :doc:`../installation` documentation and then return.

   You will need to use the command line/terminal to manage your app and run the development server. It is highly recommended that you read the :doc:`../../supplementary/terminal_quick_guide` article for some tips if you are new to command line before you get started.
