.. _contribute_intro_policies:

Community Policies
==================

To ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, we have established a set of community policies. These policies include our Code of Conduct, which outlines the standards for behavior and interactions within the Tethys Platform community. Adhering to these guidelines helps maintain a positive and productive atmosphere for everyone involved. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with these policies before contributing.

* `Code of Conduct <https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_


.. _contribute_intro_license:

Developer Certificate of Origin
===============================

**TODO**: need input on how to proceed with this. See: `GitHub Discussion: Shall we adopt a CLA or DCO? <https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys/discussions/1138>`_

To protect the rights of contributors and ensure that Tethys Platform remains open-source, we require all contributors to sign a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). This happens in an automated fashion during the submission of the first pull request. Tethys Geoscience Foundation uses the DCO developed by the Linux Foundation:
