The Tethys Platform documentation (https://docs.tethysplatform.org) is built using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ and hosted on `Read the Docs <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. The documentation is written using a lightweight markup language called `reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#rst-primer>`_. Sphinx converts the reStructuredText files into HTML, PDF, and other formats.
