Custom Quotas

**Last Updated:** September 2025

This recipe goes over how to add and enforce custom quotas. Custom quotas allow you to enforce limits on storage or other resources such as databases. Custom quotas can be enforced on either apps or users. 

Building a Custom Quota
#######################

In this example, we'll be adding a custom quota that restricts the number of measurement stations a single user can add.

Begin by adding an new file named `station_quota_handler.py`

Inside `station_quota_handler.py` add the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from tethys_quotas.handlers.base import ResourceQuotaHandler
    from .model import MeasurementStation
    from .app import App

    class StationQuotaHandler(ResourceQuotaHandler):
        """
        Defines qutoas for measurement station storage for the persistent store._custom_quotas
        
        inherits from ResourceQuotaHandler
        """

        codename = "station_quota"
        name = "Measurement Station Quota"
        description = "Set quota on station db entry stroage for persistent store."
        default = 25 # Number of stations that can be created per user
        units = "station"
        help = "You have exceeded your quote on stations. Please visit the stations page and remove any unneeded stations."
        applies_to = ["django.contrib.auth.models.User"]

        def get_current_use(self):
            """
            calculates/retrieves the current number of stations in the database that the user has added.

            Returns:
                Int: current number of stations in database
            """
            # Query database for count of stations
            Session = App.get_persistent_store_database('primary_db', as_sessionmaker=True)
            session = Session()
            current_use = session.query(MeasurementStation).filter(MeasurementStation.user_id == self.entity.id).count()

            session.close()

            return current_use

Now go into the portal's portal_config.yml file and add the dot-path of the handler class you just created in the RESOURCE_QUOTA_HANDLERS array.

.. code-block:: yaml

        settings:
          RESOURCE_QUOTA_HANDLERS:
            - tethysapp.dam_inventory.dam_quota_handler.DamQuotaHandler

A simple way to do this is in the tethys CLI by running this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    tethys settings --set settings.RESOURCE_QUOTA_HANDLERS ["tethysapp.dam_inventory.dam_quota_handler.DamQuotaHandler"]

Make sure the Tethys development server restarts by pressing CTRL-C and then running tethys manage start.

After re-starting tethys the User Dam Quota should be visible in the Resource Quota section of the admin pages. Click on it and make sure Active and Impose default are both Enabled.

Enforcing a Custom Quota
########################

To enforce your new custom quota set the enforce_quotas argument on the controllers decorator and add it to a controller:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from tethys_sdk.routing import controller
    
    @controller(url='stations/add', enforce_quotas='user_station_quota')
    def add_station(request):
        """"
        Controller for the add station page
        """
        ...

You can test this quota by logging into a non-admin account and adding 3 stations. The next time you go to the add station page, or whatever controller you've added this quota to, you'll be taken to an error page that looks like this;
