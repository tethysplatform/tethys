******************************************
Scaffold and Install an App via the Portal
******************************************

.. important::

    This feature is only available to **staff/admin users** when the ``DEBUG`` portal setting is set to ``True``.

    This recipe assumes that you have already started your Tethys server (see :ref:`start_tethys`).

Tethys Platform provides an easy way for developers to create new app projects via the Tethys Portal itself, rather than via command line.

.. note::

    See :ref:`scaffold_an_app_via_command_line` if you need to automate an install or otherwise want/need to use the command line.

.. important::

The code that was scaffolded behind the app can be found in the same directory from which you started your Tethys server via command line.

.. tip::
    
    If you are unsure of which directory your Tethys server is/was running in, you can:

    1. Return to the terminal that is/was running the server (via the ``tethys start`` command)
    2. Kill the server with Ctrl + C
    3. Enter the ``pwd`` command, which will print out the location.
