To run tests for an extension:

    1. In portal_config.yml make sure that the default database user is set to tethys_super or is a super user of the database
        DATABASES:
            default:
                ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2
                NAME: tethys_platform
                USER: tethys_super

                HOST: 127.0.0.1
                PORT: 5435

    2. From the root directory of your extension, run the ``tethys manage test`` command::

        tethys manage test tethysext/<extension_name>/tests

    You could also create multiple TethysTestCase classes within this or other python files to organize your tests.

        This function is not required, but can be used if any environmental setup needs to take place before
        execution of each test function. Thus, if you have multiple test that require the same setup to run,
        place that code here.

        If you are testing against a controller that check for certain user info, you can create a fake test user and
        get a test client, like this:

            # To force a login for the test user
            self.c.force_login(self.user)

            # If for some reason you do not want to force a login, you can use the following:
            login_success = self.c.login(username="joe", password="secret")

        then they must be placed at the beginning of your individual test functions. Also, if a certain
        setup does not apply to all of your functions, you should either place it directly in each
        function it applies to, or maybe consider creating a new test file or test class to group similar
        tests.
