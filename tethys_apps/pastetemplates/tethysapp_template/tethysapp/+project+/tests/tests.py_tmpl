To run any tests:
    1. Open a terminal
    2. Enter command ". /usr/lib/tethys/bin/activate" to activate the Tethys python environment
    3. Enter tethys test command.
       The general form is: "tethys test -f tethys_apps.tethysapp.<app_name>.<folder_name>.<file_name>.<class_name>.<function_name>"
       See below for specific examples

        To run all tests across this app:
            Test command: "tethys test -f tethys_apps.tethysapp.{{project}}"

        To run all tests in this file:
            Test command: "tethys test -f tethys_apps.tethysapp.{{project}}.tests.tests"

        To run tests in the {{proper_no_spaces}}TestCase class:
            Test command: "tethys test -f tethys_apps.tethysapp.{{project}}.tests.tests.{{proper_no_spaces}}TestCase"

        To run only the test_if_tethys_platform_is_gerat function in the {{proper_no_spaces}}TestCase class:
            Test command: "tethys test -f tethys_apps.tethysapp.{{project}}.tests.tests.{{proper_no_spaces}}TestCase.test_if_tethys_platform_is_great"

        This function is not required, but can be used if any environmental setup needs to take place before
        execution of each test function. Thus, if you have multiple test that require the same setup to run,
        place that code here. For example, if you are testing against any persistent stores, you should call the
        test database creation function here, like so:

            self.create_test_persistent_stores_for_app({{proper_no_spaces}})

        If you are testing against a controller that check for certain user info, you can create a fake test user and
        get a test client, like so:

            self.c = self.get_test_client()
            self.user = self.create_test_user(username="joe", password="secret", email="joe@some_site.com")

            # To force a login for the test user

        then they must be placed at the beginning of your individual test functions. Also, if a certain
        setup does not apply to all of your functions, you should either place it directly in each
        function it applies to, or maybe consider creating a new test file or test class to group similar
        tests.
